## Project Goals

* Estimate which is the most studied organism by percentage. The criteria used will be based on the percentage of studied proteins / total proteins of every organism. 
* Analize the data that are contained in the different databases by different prespectives:
- From which organism we have more protein structure data?
- Is there a correlation between the number of gene and the size of the genome?
- Plot the size of the protein structure solved by year in function of the technique used to determine the structure. 
- etc... 
 


* Databases : Uniprot (Proteins general info), Ensembl (Gene general info), PDB (protein structure info)






*** Option 2_ Heart disease analysis in UCI.
